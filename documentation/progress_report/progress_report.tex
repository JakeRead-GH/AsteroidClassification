\section{Introduction}

\textit{Here, write a brief introduction to the problem you are solving. This can be adapted from your problem description and motivation from the original proposal. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages. }\newline

\noindent There are tens of thousands of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) on orbit paths close to Earth, with more being discovered daily \citep{NASANEAs}. Some of these become classified as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), as they become large enough to potentially cause a problem. As more and more NEAs are discovered every day, it would be helpful to develop a machine learning classification system that would be able to classify NEAs to determine which could be hazardous. Classification of asteroids requires time-consuming analysis of a variety of features. An autonomous model would allow space agencies to dedicate more resources to observation of the detected PHAs and developing mitigation strategies. \newline

Accurate and expedient classification of asteroids is crucial to determining potential risks to planetary health. This project will develop a model to classify NEAs based on physical and orbital characteristics to determine which could be hazardous to Earth. This project will clean and pre-process the dataset, selects relevant features, and trains a model using machine learning to classify asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous. We will handle class imbalance using techniques like oversampling( e.g., SMOTE)), or weighted loss, and then evaluate the model. \newline

The dataset we will use contains an existing classification for, as well as features of thousands of discovered asteroids. The dataset is derived from NASA and JPL's Small-body and Asteroid database. The dataset contains 45 features of any known object, and we will engineer a feature set that yields the best results, clean the data and handle imbalance. \newline

\section{Related Work}

\textit{Here, talk about the related work you encountered for your approach. Cite at least 5 references. Refer to item 2. No one has done exactly your task? Write about the most similar thing you can find. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.} \newline 

\noindent \citet{NASANEOs} defines Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) based on parameters that affect the asteroid's potential to be threatening, including its closest distance to Earth, size and albedo. There have been several systems developed using various machine learning models. \newline

\noindent Results of a comparison of machine learning models to classify NEAs were published in 2022, and included comparison of logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVMs), gradient boosting, and MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). The article states that \textit{multilayer perception} and \textit{gradient boosting} yielded the most accurate results \citep{CompareML}. \newline

\noindent A further indicator of the performance of gradient boosting came from a classification project using the NGBoost classifier, a gradient boosting framework that uses natural gradient descent for optimization. Using NGBoost produced an overall accuracy of 99.22\% \citep{NGBoost}. \newline

\noindent Another article published in 2019 compares the Hierarchal Clustering Method (HCM) to a newer, \textit{supervised learning HCM} method. The supervised HCM method proved superior to the classical method, correctly identifying all asteroids within the target family and and yielding an accuracy of about 85\% \citep{HCM}. \newline

\noindent A different approach was taken by \citet{SVM}, who elected to observe subgroups of NEAs with high concentrations of PHAs, to better determine which characteristics can be used as flags of hazardous asteroids. Using a \textit{Support Vector Machine (SVM)} model, the extracted subgroups of NEAs contained about 90\% of the real and virtual PHAs. \newline 

\section{Dataset}

You should write about your dataset here, following the guidelines regarding item 1. This section may be 0.5-1 pages. Depending on your specific dataset, you may want to include subsections for the preprocessing, annotation, etc.

\section{Features}

Describe any features you used for your model, or how your data was input to your model. Are you doing feature engineering or feature selection? Are you learning embeddings? Is it all part of one neural network? Refer to item 2. This may range from 0.25 pages to 0.5 pages.

\section{Implementation}

Describe your model and implementation here. Refer to item 4. This may take around a page.

\section{Results and Evaluation}

How are you evaluating your model? What results do you have so far? What are your baselines? Refer to item 5. This may take around 0.5 pages.

\section{Feedback and Plans}

Write about your plans for the remainder of the project. This should include a discussion of the feedback you received from your TA, and how you plan to improve your approach. Reflect on your implementation and areas for improvement. Refer to item 6. This may be around 0.5 pages.

\section{Template Notes}

You can remove this section or comment it out, as it only contains instructions for how to use this template. You may use subsections in your document as you find appropriate.

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

\subsection{References}

\nocite{Ando2005,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015}

Many websites where you can find academic papers also allow you to export a bib file for citation or bib formatted entry. Copy this into the \texttt{custom.bib} and you will be able to cite the paper in the \LaTeX{}. You can remove the example entries.

\subsection{Equations}

An example equation is shown below:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:example}
  A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

Labels for equation numbers, sections, subsections, figures and tables
are all defined with the \verb|\label{label}| command and cross references
to them are made with the \verb|\ref{label}| command.
This an example cross-reference to Equation~\ref{eq:example}. You can also write equations inline, like this: $A=\pi r^2$.
